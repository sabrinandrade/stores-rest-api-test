# Stores REST Api

## About
This is a simple store API. As models, we have items, stores, and users who can log into the system to perform certain operations. 
The core of the API was not built from the ground up, and the goal for this project was to practice automated testing with Python.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.6
* Flask
* Flask RESTful
* Flask-JWT
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
